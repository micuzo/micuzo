### Hi there 👋🏿

I’m Michael, an aspiring Software Developer. I’m in the final year of my studies as a computer science student at Carleton University, scheduled to graduate in April 2023.

Over the past two years I’ve been lucky enough to intern for various companies, each working to solve unique problems. As a result, I’ve had to wear a lot of different hats, ranging from working in QA to working on large scale desktop and web applications.
