### Hi there 👋🏿

I’m Michael, an aspiring Software Developer and a recent computer science graduate from Carleton University.

Over the past two years I’ve been lucky enough to intern for various companies, each working to solve unique problems. As a result, I’ve had to wear a lot of different hats, ranging from working in QA to working on large scale desktop and web applications.
